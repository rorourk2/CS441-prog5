This app presents the user with a text input, a number, and two buttons
Typing a number into the input and pressing the "Add" will add the number to a recycle viewer as well as to the total at the top.
Clicking on an element in the recycleViewer will remove it from the Viewer as well as the total
Closing the app will save the elements of the recycleViewer which will be recreated upon reopening the apps
The total will also be recreated upon reopening the app
